Code to replicate figures in "Pinging the brain with visual impulses reveals electrically active, not activity-silent working memories", Joao Barbosa, Diego Lozano-Soldevilla & Albert Compte, Plos Biology (in press). [Click here for slighly outdated psyarxiv link.](https://psyarxiv.com/qv6fu/) 

IMPORTANT: We did not collect the data analyzed in this paper. Consider downloading and citing the original datasets from the original publications.

Single-trial [decoding accuracies](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4j0wkxqvmazk0xn/AABFMWk2Ef_O9BKLcAGjisGra?dl=0) (used in Fig 2 and 3) and [Data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hrjhfjivu5wkbre/AAD-8rNc-Vj2YL-3GsYB2Ui2a?dl=0) (used in Fig 4) need to be downloaded separatedly for the scripts to run properly. 

If you need to use this slighly modified data (mostly concatenated), **you must cite the original studies anyway.**


The folder decoders/matlab_code contain the original decoding scripts of [Wolff et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4546)
 with minor modifications, most notably the conversion to alpha power.
