Code to replicate figures in "Pinging reveals active, not silent, working memories", Joao Barbosa, Diego Lozano-Soldevilla & Albert Compte

IMPORTANT: I did not collect the data analyzed in this paper. Consider downloading and citing the original datasets from the original publications.

[Wolff et al 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2015.00123/full)  
[Wolff et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4546)


Single-trial decoding accuracies (used in Fig 2 and 3) and Data (used in Fig 4) need to be downloaded separatedly for the scripts to run properly. If you need to use this slighly modified data (mostly concatenated), you must cite the original studies anyway. Decoding accuracies and Data modified to work with our scripts can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vs55w1dj93v8fd0/AADmLL3tpX7RTQu9QOlxekG8a?dl=0).
