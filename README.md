Code to replicate figures in "Pinging reveals active, not silent, working memories", Joao Barbosa, Diego Lozano-Soldevilla & Albert Compte

IMPORTANT: I did not collect the data analyzed in this paper. Consider downloading the original datasets from the original publications.

Decoding accuracies and Data need to be downloaded separatedly for the scripts to run properly. If you need to use the slighly modified data (mostly concatenated), you must cite the original studies anyway. Decoding accuracies and Data modified to work with our scripts can be downloaded here. 


Any questions should be directed to Joao Barbosa, palerma@gmail.com
